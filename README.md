# Project-2

My project idea was a web app to share and connect with the hiking community. You can create your own hikes and post it to the country-wide map so that other people can join.

Here is my [trello check list](https://trello.com/b/zr8nIbNN/hike-social-app). I originally estimated that this would take about 52-63 hours, I hit just about 50.

Here are my wireframes for this project.

There was originally a simple login page, a discover page which everyone would see, and a form page which you could add new ones.
